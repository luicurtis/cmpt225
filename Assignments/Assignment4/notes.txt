	- char is 8 bits
	- for loop starts at 7
	- every loop it's going to shift right i bits and bitwise AND with that bit

	- reading binary file into integer
Compressed File
- Needs to contain the # of bytes as the first thing in the file
	- this number refers to the number of bytes of the huffman tree


TODO:
- Create huffman tree class
	- storing huffman tree
		- store the character followed by the frequency of that character
			- total will be 8 + 8 bits
				-store frequency as a char
	- Figure out how to determine huffman code and wreit code to compressed file

	- Rebuilding
