 *   - a copy constructor that creates a distinct copy of the given object
 * (even if the client code does not make use of all of these constructors).

/* Note that the compiler will generate a copy constructor automatically.  
 * However, this constructor only creates a SHALLOW COPY (so would only copy the
 * elementCount and head variables). In this case, this would NOT CREATE A
 * NEW LIST object, just a new reference to "this" List object.  
 * It is therefore necessary to write a constructor that makes a DEEP COPY
 * if our class makes use of dynamically allocated memory.
 */

/* Also note the parameter. C++ functions use pass-by-value by
 * default. This means that the functions make copies of the given
 * arguments. This is inefficient (particularly for large objects).
 * Therefore it is normal to pass a reference, (using &) of the parameter,
 * called an "alias".
 * Furthermore, if the parameter cannot be changed, it is good programming practice 
 * to indicate so by using the keyword "const". This keyword prevents it from being changed,
 * i.e., the compiler will complaint if the code tries to change the value of the parameter.
