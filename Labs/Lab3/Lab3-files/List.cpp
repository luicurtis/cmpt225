// Constructors and Destructors

/* Generally, if a class makes use of dynamic memory allocation,
 * we should provide at least two constructors: a default constructor and
 * a copy constructor that creates a deep copy of the given object.
 */

// Description: Default constructor
List::List()
{
	elementCount = 0;
	head = NULL;
}

/* Note that the compiler will generate a copy constructor automatically.
 * However, this constructor only creates a SHALLOW COPY (so would only copy the
 * elementCount and head variables). In this case, this would NOT CREATE A
 * NEW LIST object, just a new reference to "this" List object.
 * It is therefore necessary to write a constructor that makes a DEEP COPY
 * if our class makes use of dynamically allocated memory.
 */

/* Also note the parameter. C++ functions use pass-by-value by
 * default. This means that the functions make copies of the given
 * arguments. This is inefficient (particularly for large objects).
 * Therefore it is normal to pass a reference, (using &) to the parameter.
 * Also, if the parameter must not be changed,
 * it is good practice to make it const, which prevents it from being changed.
 */
// Description: Copy constructor to copy an existing List object.
List::List(const List& lst)
{
	elementCount = lst.elementCount;
	// head = lst.head; //shallow copy - you need to fix this!

	Node* cur = lst.head;

	while (cur->next != NULL)
	{
		add(cur->data);
		cur = cur->next;
	}

	// Add the last element
	add(cur->data);
}

/* The destructor is responsible for deleting any memory that was dynamically
 * allocated by an object. If there is no such memory, no destructor needs to
 * be created (the compiler automatically creates one). Because this class
 * uses memory dynamically allocated (and pointers) when new Node objects are
 * instantiated, it is necessary to write a destructor.
 * Destructors are identified by the '~' preceding the class name.
 * There can be only one destructor for a class, and it cannot have parameters.

 * Note that there is some debate about whether or not this type of
 * method belongs in a class. The argument (briefly) is that a class
 * shouldn't be responsible for I/O by "displaying" itself as it cannot
 * foresee how it is to be displayed (in a TUI or GUI environment).
 * However, such method eases testing.
 * For testing purpose, unless required by client in problem statement.
 * Could also overload operator<<.
