		* we should provide at least two constructors: a default constructor and
		* a copy constructor that creates a deep copy of the given object.
		*/

		// Description: Default constructor
		List();

		/* Note that the compiler will generate a copy constructor automatically.
		* However, this constructor only creates a SHALLOW COPY (so would only copy the
		* elementCount and head variables). In this case, this would NOT CREATE A
		* NEW LIST object, just a new reference to "this" List object.
		* It is therefore necessary to write a constructor that makes a DEEP COPY
		* if our class makes use of dynamically allocated memory.
		*/

		/* Also note the parameter. C++ functions use pass-by-value by
		* default. This means that the functions make copies of the given
		* arguments. This is inefficient (particularly for large objects).
		* Therefore it is normal to pass a reference, (using &) to the parameter.
		* Also, if the parameter must not be changed,
		* it is good practice to make it const, which prevents it from being changed.
		*/
		// Description: Copy constructor to copy an existing List object.
		List(const List& lst); //copy constructor

		/* The destructor is responsible for deleting any memory that was dynamically
		* allocated by an object. If there is no such memory, no destructor needs to
		* be created (the compiler automatically creates one). Because this class
		* uses memory dynamically allocated (and pointers) when new Node objects are
		* instantiated, it is necessary to write a destructor.
		* Destructors are identified by the '~' preceding the class name.
		* There can be only one destructor for a class, and it cannot have parameters.

		* Note that there is some debate about whether or not this type of
		* method belongs in a class. The argument (briefly) is that a class
		* shouldn't be responsible for I/O by "displaying" itself as it cannot
		* foresee how it is to be displayed (in a TUI or GUI environment).
		* However, such method eases testing.
		* For testing purpose, unless required by client in problem statement.
		* Could also overload operator<<.
